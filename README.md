BikeForums.net DeArchiver
=========================

When searching for bicycle related information one often ends up at BikeForums.net. However one also typically ends up on an archived page such as [this one](http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-264348.html#redirecting). This extension automatically redirects you from the archive page to the full forum thread ([this page for the prior example](http://www.bikeforums.net/showthread.php/264348-The-BEST-freewheel)).

Q&A
---

Q: Why not simply redirect from the search result directly to the thread bypassing the archive page?

A: The extension only has permissions to www.bikeforums.net/archive/*. Having it do this would require permissions to multiple search engines plus additional support if the links to the archive content are not direct.

Q: Does the back button still work?

A: Yes, the back button still works.
